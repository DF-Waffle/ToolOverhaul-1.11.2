# ToolOverhaul-1.11.2


Tool Overhaul adds Obsidian, Emerald and Nether Star tools. Each have their own sets of durability and as you might expect the Nether Star tools are very powerful.  It also adds a new block which is the Nether Star block which can be used to compact your Nether Stars for easier storage. This mod also adds obsidian ingots which is used to craft obsidian tools. Paxels are also the newest tools added to the game which are a combination of a Pickaxe, Shovel and Axe.
